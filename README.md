# Hi!

### I'm Jack Henza.

I've spent the last ten years working in a variety of technical fields including both machine and hand-tool based manufacturing, CMS based web development, and classroom education. With a B.S. in Sustainable Technologies and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Software Engineering from FlatIron School, my educational and professional experience provide a strong foundation upon which to tackle complex problems and develop practical solutions. Trained as a builder and engineer I approach projects with an investigative mindset prototyping and testing processes while able to appropriately adapt to the evolving needs of a project.

I am experienced in Java, Python, Flask SQLAlchemy, JS, and React and I am constantly exposing myself to new tools to better support my projects. I work well independently, but I thrive in team-based environments.

In addition to my passion for creating new software projects, I am a DnD player with a penchant for hiking in as many countries as my wife and I can get to.
